Parts List For Servo Controls:
-ARDX Arduino Experimenters Kit from Solarbotics
-2 Hitec HS-645MG High Torque Servo
-1 Hitec HS-311 //Ideally, replace this with another high torque servo but this is what we had
-2 Potentiometers from the Solarbotics Arduino Kit  //the kit only has one included but we had multiple kits
-1 Pushbutton from the Solarbotics Arduino Kit  //any momentary switch will do
-1 Koyo Thrust needle roller bearing
-a few CD's

For our base, we decided to go with an old Dell Optiplex 990 DT
An arm from a piece of wood we had lying around
and our paintball marker was Stryker Cybrid PaintBall Marker.
For the mount, we layered popsicle sticks until it was large enough
to cover a good portion of the marker.
Making two blockes like these, we used wing nuts
and bolts to hold the marker in place.

Building:
For the arm, we followed the design SentryGun53 had for his tutorial.
We cut the wooden pieces to length after factoring the size of the paintball marker 
and joined them with two mending braces and two corner braces.
Then, we cut slots into the aluminum case and the wooden arm 
for the base and arm servos to fit in. 
After securing the servos, we put The thrust needle roller bearing between two CD's
like LinusTechTips did in their Nerf Turret, cutting out parts of the CD's to fit
the servos through, making sure that the servo and its horns could move smoothly.
We layered CD's ion between the arm and the base until there was sufficient
contact between the arm and the cd's.
